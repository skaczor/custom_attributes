Permits managing custom attributes for Active Record models. Unlike other plugins,
custom_attributes uses an associated model to define which columns should be
available for the current model.

For example, suppose that you have a catalog of items for sale (Item model),
such as Monitors, Hard Disks, etc. Each item needs attributes that are specific
only for its category (Category Model). Therefore, let's define that Monitors
should have the display_size and dpi attributes, while Hard Disks should define
capacity and rpm.

class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Customizable
  defines_custom_columns
end

class Item < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :category

  include Customizable
  has_custom_attributes_based_on(:category)
end

The plugin will automatically create the required attributes for each Item model,
based on its association with the Category model.
